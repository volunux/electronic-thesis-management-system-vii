A web application that allows storage and sharing of undergraduate and graduate thesis projects

**Note: This app is deployed on Google App Engine and would take 1-15 seconds to start due to hibernation and idleness for 10min if no activity, before 15 seconds you will experience 502 Gateway Nginx.**

You can visit https://aremi-thesis.ey.r.appspot.com/ to get started

You can use an existing account by signing in with **davidjohn@gmail.com** as email address and **1234567890** as the password.

Or if you want, you can create a new account.

A user can add items (i.e. thesis and research work to cart) and later make payment for the items.

After purchasing items, you will be redirected to the dashboard displaying your order details and then visit https://aremi-thesis.ey.r.appspot.com/download/user to download materials for 
the items you purchase.

You can also upload your final year project which would be reviewed by the admin before being approved.
